The executable is in the debug folder once you open the folder P0.Hsia.V1. It is not
in the Debug folder after you click the Project1 folder
The source code is available to access several ways. You may click on the sln file or
click on the Project1 folder and then click on the Proj1.cpp.

Note: I copied everything from the downloaded files from myasu, basic.c, into the new
file Proj1.cpp. This is why you see Proj1.cpp instead of basic.c.

A) There is no special keys, except that to exit, simply click the x button
on the top right corner
B) Some special functions that I implemented is when I resive the window, the color
stays the same.
C) There was no negotiation with the TA. The instructions simply said to change the color
and make sure the color doesn't change after resizing
D) I think openl is pretty cool and important
E) I used the glut32.dll and glut32.lib
